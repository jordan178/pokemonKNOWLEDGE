Fake GPS Tips

Listen up boys:

Step 1: Go to https://pokevision.com/ and choose your area

Step 2: When you find a good pokemon use fakegps on bluestacks and click on it

Step 3: WAIT

Step 4: Im serious, don't throw any pokeballs, you might have been softbanned for like 5 minutes for teleporting too far. What I just figured out is that you can start the fight with the pokemon and then just go afk and wait for some time (like 10min should be fine). After waiting for some time you can just try to catch it like you would normally catch a pokemon.

This might not sound spectacular but it's the only way to bypass a softban. When rare pokemon like dragonite spawn, they wont last the typical 12 min or so, they only spawn for like 5 min. When you port there and get softbanned for 5 min guess what, you can't catch it.
This is why I created this guide. Thanks for reading, if you want more tips like this just reply and show interest ^^
